I'm Eliathah, a software developer from Grand Junction, CO. This is my personal blog, where I talk about web development.

## My Background

I was introduced to the tech world at age 16, when I taught myself HTML and CSS. That led to an internship with a small local web design firm (Flexiss), which became a full-time SEO job when the company shifted from design and development to internet marketing.

I spent the next few years as an SEO specialist alongside Search Engine Academy instructor Ross Barefoot, first at his company Extreme Exposure Promotions, and then with his current employer Horizon Web Marketing. During that time, I taught myself Ruby so that I could automate certain repetitive tasks, which led to the realization that I liked programming more than SEO. Now I build software for a living and am a Co-Founder and CTO of [Seamly](https://getseamly.com).
